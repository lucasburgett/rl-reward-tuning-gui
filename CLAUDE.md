# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an early-stage RL (Reinforcement Learning) reward tuning GUI project. The repository is currently minimal, containing only basic project structure with:

- MIT License
- Standard Python .gitignore (configured for various Python tools including PyCharm, VSCode, Ruff, etc.)
- Basic README with project title only

## Current State

The codebase is in its initial stages with no source code, dependencies, or build configuration yet established. The project appears to be set up for Python development based on the comprehensive .gitignore file that includes patterns for:

- Python packaging tools (pip, poetry, pipenv, pdm, pixi)
- Testing frameworks (pytest, coverage, tox)
- Development environments (venv, conda, etc.)
- IDEs (PyCharm, VSCode, Cursor)
- Linting tools (Ruff, mypy, pytype)

## Development Environment

No specific development commands, build processes, or testing frameworks have been configured yet. The project structure suggests this will be a Python-based application for RL reward tuning with a graphical user interface.

## Architecture Notes

The project architecture is not yet defined as no source code exists. The name suggests it will involve:
- Reinforcement Learning components for reward tuning
- A GUI interface for user interaction
- Python as the primary development language

Future instances should expect to set up the initial project structure, dependencies, and development workflow as the project evolves.
